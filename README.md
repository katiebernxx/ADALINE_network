# ADALINE_network : Single Layer Neural Network Project
A single layer ADALINE network built from scratch without the use of machine learning libaries

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a single-layer neural network model, specifically ADALINE (ADaptive LInear NEuron), and applying it to binary classification and regression tasks. The main objective is to analyze the inner workings of neural networks and examine the affects of various hyperparameters with the well-known Old Faithful and Ionosphere datasets. By exploring the performance of ADALINE and perceptron-based models, this project investigates how single-layer networks create decision boundaries and perform classification.

## Project Structure

### Notebooks and Code Files

- **binary_classification.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating binary classification using the ADALINE and perceptron models on the Old Faithful dataset.
- **adaline.py**: Contains the core ADALINE model implementation for single-layer networks, with methods for prediction, loss calculation, and gradient-based weight updates.
- **adaline_logistic.py**: Extension of the ADALINE model for logistic regression.

### Data Files
